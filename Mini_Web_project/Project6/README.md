# Glassmorphism Login Form (Dark Theme)

A small, modern login form demonstrating the glassmorphism UI pattern with a dark theme. Built with plain HTML and CSS, this project is designed to be lightweight and easy to customize.

## Files

- `index.html` — The login form markup.
- `style.css` — Styles implementing the glass effect, dark theme, and responsive layout.

## Features

- Glassmorphism effect using `backdrop-filter` and semi-transparent backgrounds.
- Dark theme with a blurred background image.
- Floating labels and icon support (Font Awesome).
- Responsive layout and subtle micro-interactions.

## How to view

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. No build steps or dependencies required.

## Customize

- Change the background image by editing the `background-image` URL in `style.css`.
- Adjust blur and transparency via `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` and the `rgba(...)` alpha values.
- Edit colors and spacing in `style.css` to match your branding.
