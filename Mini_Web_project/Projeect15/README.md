# Dot Navigation Menu

A tiny, beginner-friendly example of a dot navigation menu made with HTML and CSS, plus a small JavaScript snippet for keyboard support.

Files:
- `index.html` — demo markup and small script
- `style.css` — simple styles you can change easily

How to try:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click any dot to change the active panel.
3. Focus a dot and use Arrow Left/Right (or Up/Down) to move.

Customize:
- Change the color by editing `--accent` in `style.css`.
- Add or remove list items in the `.dots` list to change the number of dots.

This project is intentionally simple so you can learn and adapt it for your portfolio.
